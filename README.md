# mollex: mollusc extractor

mollex extracts molluscoid shapes from images.
Mollusca is a phylum containing cephalopods (octopods etc.)
and gastropods (such as snails and slugs).
More precisely, the
_Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Berlin_ kindly provided us with a large
collection of molluscs as part of the [Coding da Vinci](https://codingdavinci.de)
hackathon.

mollex works by removing the background, performing some adaptive
prefiltering and finally finding contours that match typical
molluscoid shapes.

We tested mollex only on snail-like shapes.
